1. Use `yarn` package manager as we use yarn to scaffolde the app. See https://yarnpkg.com
2. Make a separate branch per feature added or bug fixed. Make a different PR for each so that we can track history better.
3. **DO NOT COMMIT CHANGES THAT BREAKS THE RENDER**
4. No uncessary discussion about style guide. Always run precommit hook as that prettier and eslint can format. You can add them to you editor as well
5. Open a new issue for a new feature
6. Keep you commit messages meaningful
7. Running tests before commit is recommended
8. Do not commit package-lock.json as we are using yarn.lock
9. Keep you environment vars in .env file
10. Happy coding!!
